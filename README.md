# NFL Player Stat Prediction

This project predicts NFL stats for quarterbacks (QBs), running backs (RBs), and wide receivers (WRs) using polynomial linear regression models. It uses historical play-by-play data to calculate features from previous seasons and trains models to predict touchdowns.

## Features
- Polynomial regression for QBs, RBs, and WRs
- Loads and processes NFL play-by-play data
- Models evaluate performance using RMSE and RÂ²
- Highlights most accurate player predictions
